# School_District_Analysis

Python School District Standardized Test Analysis

## Background

The chieft Data Scientist for a school district is preparing an all standarized test analysis to provide insight in performance trend and patterns. We will help "The Chief Data Scientist" analyze data on student fundings and standarized test using Python.

## Project Overview

The school board has notified that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered.

We have been ask to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once we’ve replaced the math and reading scores, then to repeat the school district analysis and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Resources

* Data source: students_complete.csv
* Software: Python 3.7.6, JupyterLab 3.4.3

## Schools Audit Results

### Analysis

* How is the district summary affected?

* How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

* #### Math and reading scores by grade

* #### Scores by school spending

    Small and Medium size schools outperformed larger size schools in math scores, reading scores and in all % to include % Oveall Passing. The larger schools percentage pasing is very differnt and is pulling the overal passing percentage down for district schools.

* #### Scores by school type
